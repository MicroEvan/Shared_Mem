# Shared_Mem
Process communication using shared memory involves at least two processes by definition, often referred to as a Reader and a Writer.  The program implements a Writer program that creates a shared memory segment, then repeatedly accepts an arbitrary user input string from the terminal and writes it into shared memory.  A corresponding Reader program is also created; two instances of reader will attach to the same shared memory segment, repeatedly read each new string from the shared memory and display the string to the screen.  The idea is similar to the "echo" command, or to the operation of a pipe, except that this implements two Reader processes.  In this sense, it functions a little like the typescript utility, which sends output to both the display and to a file.  This program sends output to two different window displays.  Separate programs are written for each process type and then run in their own terminal window.  This clearly demonstrates the communication mechanism involved in using shared memory.
